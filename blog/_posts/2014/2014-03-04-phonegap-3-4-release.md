The Adobe PhoneGap team is happy to announce the release of PhoneGap 3.4.0!

## FireFox OS

By far the biggest new feature is [FireFox OS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Firefox_OS) support!

FireFox OS is referenced as firefoxos in phonegap commands. To compile a FireFox OS PhoneGap app, run:

    $ phonegap build firefoxos

To find out how to use the compiled FireFox OS package with the Mozilla App Manager, [Mozilla put together a guide using the Cordova CLI](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2014/02/building-cordova-apps-for-firefox-os/). All the steps should be the same from 'Debugging the App' onward.

This is on top of usual hardening and bug fixes.

There are a large number of bug fixes and improvements to the Cordova engine across iOS, Android, BlackBerry10 and Windows Phone 8. 

If youâ€™re interested in diving into the details, then [checkout the Cordova release notes](https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=12312420%26version=12324813).
