Onsen CSS Components is a web-based theme roller for Topcoat that lets PhoneGap developers create beautiful UIs easily. Many standard UI components are supported and are easily customizable via a web interface. It also has a growing selection of beautiful UI patterns, each containing HTML and CSS to show how to reproduce the pattern.

You can copy the markup and use it with the downloaded CSS file. If you just want to use only a few components, you can just copy the CSS code of those components.

#### UI Patterns

In the **Overview** panel, you can scroll through collections of beautiful UI patterns. This is not just eye candy; you can inspect the source code. We make it easy to copy and past the code to your project. We will keep adding more patterns. If you cannot find a pattern you want, you can request one by clicking the **Request** button; or you can contribute your own pattern via the **Register** button.
