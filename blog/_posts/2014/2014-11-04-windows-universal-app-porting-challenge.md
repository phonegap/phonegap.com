I'm excited to announce our Windows Universal App Porting Challenge for all U.S. PhoneGap developers. Take your Google Play Store or Apple Store app, port it to a Windows Universal App and submit it to our Windows and Windows Phone Store for a chance to win.  

- First prize is a Surface Pro 3 w/ Type Cover AND a Nokia Lumia 1520
- Second place is a Surface Pro 3 w/ Type Cover
- Third place is a Nokia Lumia 1520  

The grand prize is $1,000,000 in unmarked bills. The previous sentence is not true.  

How do you win? It’s easy – make sure your app looks gorgeous, offers a ton of functionality and is unique. The judges from Microsoft and Adobe will review the apps and award the top 3. That's it!  

Contest submissions end on Dec 1st and we will announce the winner thereafter. Even better, entries are not limited. As long as the app you submit was already published in the Google Play Store or Apple Store. For those of you who love to read long legal documents and terms of service, you can find our rules [here](http://phonegap2014.azurewebsites.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/phonegap-Windows-Universal-App-contest-final-rules.pdf). It's a glorious read.  

We announced the contest last week at the amazing [PhoneGap Day US](http://phonegap.com/blog/2014/11/02/recapping-phonegap-day-us-2014/) in San Francisco. So, if you're reading this for the first time, you're already behind! GO!
