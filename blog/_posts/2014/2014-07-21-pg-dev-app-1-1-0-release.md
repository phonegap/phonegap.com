the features and fixes are a direct result of our community! We not only received
plenty of positive reviews, but also submitted issues, feature requests, and pull requests!

## What's New

- Updated to Cordova 3.5.0
- Updated all plugins to be Cordova 3.5.0 compliant

- Enabled multi-device and multi-version support with the CLI
- Fixed minor bugs and rendering issues

You can [read the complete change log][1] in our repository.

## Download

If you've already downloaded the app, then your device will likely auto-update the app.

and [Windows Phone][4] by searching for _PhoneGap Developer_.

Also, remember to update your PhoneGap CLI to the latest version (`3.5.0-0.20.7`) to
get multi-device and multi-version support:

    $ sudo npm update -g phonegap

or

    C:\> npm update -g phonegap
