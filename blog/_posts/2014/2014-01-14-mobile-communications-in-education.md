The Surrey School District is the largest school district in British Columbia, so it’s no surprise that the challenge of efficiently and effectively communicating with multiple audiences can be a challenge. While the school websites offered a good framework for district communications and school communications, they were an inadequate channel for parents, who needed to stay up-to-date in real time.
 
The district decided to take a new approach to keeping parents up to date, with a custom mobile app. We were thrilled to work with the district to create SchoolLink, a cross-platform mobile app that provides important information to parents—such as school closures, early dismissals, school news, and emergencies—on their iOS or Android phones and tablets.
 
Our team chose Adobe PhoneGap to build the app because it let us easily push content authored in SharePoint—the service used by the district’s 900 content contributors—to PhoneGap in a technology agnostic way, while leveraging our existing development skills. After building the iOS version, we were able to reuse about 75% of the existing iOS code for the Android version. With the ability to reuse the code, it allowed us to have a production ready version for the Android app in half the time as the first iOS version.
 
We easily create app layouts and interface designs in Photoshop, and then used CSS to create simple animations and smooth transitions between pages. The results so far have been impressive. In the first two months of the SchoolLink rollout on iOS, the district logged about 5,000 downloads, sent more than 115,000 push notices, and received positive feedback from parents. We’re happy to have worked on this project with the Surrey School District and look forward to supporting the district’s growth with new SchoolLink features and functionality, including two-way communications, in the future.
