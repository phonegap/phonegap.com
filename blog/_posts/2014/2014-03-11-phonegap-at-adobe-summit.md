The PhoneGap team is excited to be headed to the [Adobe Summit](http://summit.adobe.com/na/) from March 24-28 in Salt Lake City, UT. We'll be sharing some news as well as have a hands-on lab to learn more about a new offering, PhoneGap Enterprise. 

**L712 - Hands-on Lab: Building mobile apps with PhoneGap Enterprise**

Learn how to build mobile applications for iPhone and Android using PhoneGap Enterprise and [Adobe Experience Manager](http://www.adobe.com/solutions/web-experience-management.html). Put together a multiscreen mobile app, test it in simulators, and learn how to keep it updated—all using the familiar authoring interface of Experience Manager. 

In this hands-on lab: 
– Build your own mobile application 
– Test your application in simulators 
– Update your application on the fly
