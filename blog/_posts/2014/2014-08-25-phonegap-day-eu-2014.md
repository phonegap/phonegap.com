Hey everyone! It’s that time again: [PhoneGap Day EU!](http://pgday.phonegap.com/eu2014/) This year we’ve moved the event to Berlin on September 26. PhoneGap has grown significantly these past years with many thousands of developers publishing apps on all the stores. 

We’d like to invite you to join us and share in the community experiences, learn best practices from each other, and sample fine German beer!!!

At the event you will:

* Attend an entire day of workshops covering every aspect of developing apps using PhoneGap
* Learn how to get the most out of our cloud compiler PhoneGap/Build
* Lose the SDKs! Learn how to author your apps using the brand new PhoneGap Developer App from the devs that wrote it
* Get the scoop on our latest offering PhoneGap Enterprise
* Hear from our community on the latest updates to mobile web tech

All of this and more! The big day itself we’ll be unveiling some fresh code, showing you the sweetest in new web tech for building apps for all platforms. We hope you will join us to celebrate the mobile web and PhoneGap. [Sign up today!](http://pgday.phonegap.com/eu2014/)
