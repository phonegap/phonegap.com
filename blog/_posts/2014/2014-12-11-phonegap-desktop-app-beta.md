## Easy to Use

The PhoneGap Desktop App is the easiest way to get started with PhoneGap. It's an alternative to the PhoneGap CLI, yet it uses the same libraries under-the-hood.

There's no complicated installation. You don't need git, npm, or even node.js. We include all of the important parts for you, so that you can focus on creating your next app!

We also continue to promote cross-platform love. The PhoneGap Desktop App works on Windows and Mac. If you're on a Linux box, then let us know so that we can support it too!

### 3. Start the Server
