It's only been a week and we're already feeling a little nostalgic for PhoneGap Day US 2014. Thanks to everyone who made it out! It was truly incredible meeting all of you and hearing all the great things you're doing with PhoneGap. This year we switched things up a bit and held our 4th annual PhoneGap Day US at Dogpatch Studios in San Francisco, CA. From an amazing speaker line up to a pub mixer to end the event, we hope you walked away with some valuable content and connections.

Here are some of our favorite highlights:  

###Pre-conference workshops  

You asked, we listened. We doubled down on workshops this year with beginner, advanced, and God Mode tracks, as well as an amazing PhoneGap Ecosystem track including a Firefox OS App workshop and performance tips with [Mobify](http://www.mobify.com/).  

Workshops were a huge hit this year with a long line of attendees itching to get started well before registration opened. The sessions were great whether you're new to PhoneGap or a seasoned veteran.  

Michael Brooks - [Essentials: Beginner Track](https://github.com/mwbrooks/phonegap-day-workshop-beginner/wiki)  
Christophe Coenraets - [Building Native-Like PhoneGap Apps](http://ccoenraets.github.io/pgday14/#0) and [Ionic Tutorial](http://ccoenraets.github.io/ionic-tutorial/)  
Holly Schinsky - [Build a Hybrid Mobile Application](http://hollyschinsky.github.io/phonegap-workshop/) and [Advanced PhoneGap Hybrid App Tutorial](http://hollyschinsky.github.io/ConferenceTracker/)  
Jesse MacFadyen - [Plugin Authoring](http://purplecabbage.github.io/slides/pgd14Plugins/index.html#/)  

###What's New  

We dove into some great stuff coming up for PhoneGap like the new PhoneGap Developer Apps. The [Desktop GUI](https://github.com/phonegap/phonegap-gui/releases) provides a visual interface to create/manage PhoneGap projects and the [Developer App](http://app.phonegap.com/) can help you preview how your app will look on a device and make real-time changes. [PhoneGap Enterprise](http://enterprise.phonegap.com/) also made an appearance. Authoring mobile apps within a CMS and updating OTA? Yes, please. More to come on that soon!
