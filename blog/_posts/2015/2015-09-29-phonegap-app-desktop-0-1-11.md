The PhoneGap Desktop App 0.1.11 is now available. This is a maintenance release that uses npm v3.3.3 to build the PhoneGap Desktop.

## Installation ##

You can install the latest version of the PhoneGap Desktop App from our docs:

- [Install on OS X](http://docs.phonegap.com/references/desktop-app/install/mac/)
- [Install on Windows](http://docs.phonegap.com/references/desktop-app/install/win/)

_If you have an issue with PhoneGap Desktop's auto-updater, we recommend that you manually update using the instructions provided above._

## What's New ##

For those interested in the full CHANGELOG:

[#373](https://github.com/phonegap/phonegap-app-desktop/issues/373) nwjs Helper process uses 100% CPU
[#445](https://github.com/phonegap/phonegap-app-desktop/issues/445) modify grunt task to clean build directory
