<p>A big thanks to everyone who was able to make it to PhoneGap Day EU 2015 in Amsterdam. We'll be posting more videos from the conference so check back on our <a href="http://phonegap.com/blog/tag/phonegap-day/">blog</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/PhoneGap">Youtube channel</a>.</p>

<p>Do you ever wish your users were more engaged with your app? Or that you could update its content more easily? In this session <a href="https://twitter.com/macdonst">Simon MacDonald</a>, Sr. Software Engineer at Adobe, covers best practices when it comes to push notifications and gives a great overview of the new, easier to configure and use Push Plugin and how to deliver content and code updates using the all new, all different Content Sync plugin.</p>
