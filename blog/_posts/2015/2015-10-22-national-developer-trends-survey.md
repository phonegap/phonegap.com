Which IoT platforms are competing with Apple and Google? 
Which are the most popular cloud APIs? Does mobile, IoT or cloud development pay better? These are just some of the questions that our friends at VisionMobile tackle in their latest Developer Economics research. Take their 10-minute [National Trends survey](http://vmob.me/DE1Q16Adobe) and help piece together 2015’s hottest developer trends.

Participants can win awesome prizes like an MS Surface 3, Lumia 635, iPhone 6s, Parrot AR Drone 2.0, Blackberry Passport, as well as one of 200 Amazon vouchers! In addition to prizes, survey participants will also get the chance to see:

 1. How they compare to other developers from their country/region
 2. How their country compares to other countries from the developer landscape

Access to graphs will be given upon survey completion and upon survey closing respectively. As always, the key findings will be released as a free report in February. 

Developer Economics is the largest, most global developer research program today. Now reaching 13,000+ developers in over 140 countries, VisionMobile’s Developer Economics is the de-facto leader in tracking developer trends. 

Currently in its 10th edition, the research program tracks developer sentiment across platforms, revenues, apps, tools, APIs, segments, business models, and regions. Metrics include monetization for mobile and cloud, IoT popularity, desktop app positioning, and much more. Take the survey and win some prizes while you're at it.
