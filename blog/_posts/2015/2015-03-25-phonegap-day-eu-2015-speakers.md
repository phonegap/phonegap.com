We had an awesome turnout for our first PhoneGap Day EU in 2013 and we're thrilled to do it again! On Monday, May 18th, we're hosting our second PhoneGap Day EU at [Het Compagnietheater](http://www.compagnietheater.nl/compagnietheater.html) in Amsterdam. 

We're excited to announce a [killer lineup of speakers](http://pgday.phonegap.com/eu2015/) all ready to share tips and best practices in mobile development, experiences with coding and performance, and the latest mobile trends. Be sure to check out the [PhoneGap Day site](http://pgday.phonegap.com/eu2015/) for the full list.

Tickets are going fast so be sure to register quick! Still need some convincing? Here are our top 5 reasons to attend:

1. Front row seats to experts in keynotes and breakouts to learn everything from driving user growth for your app to plugins and performance
2. Meet and mingle with other people who use PhoneGap as part of their mobile app development
3. Get the inside scoop on the latest and greatest with PhoneGap tools, apps, and more
4. Meet the PhoneGap team and connect with other industry experts
5. Exclusive, limited edition swag for all attendees (we're not saying to only come for the swag... but it's pretty awesome)

Lastly, we doubled down on workshops last year at PhoneGap Day US 2014 and we'll be bringing that to Amsterdam. Expect some hands-on workshops from PhoneGap experts on everything from getting started with PhoneGap to intermediate and advanced techniques.
