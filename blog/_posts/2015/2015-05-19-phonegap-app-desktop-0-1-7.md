We had to quickly release PhoneGap Desktop App 0.1.7 Beta to fix a critical bug found in PhoneGap Desktop App 0.1.6 Beta.

## Installation ##

Download and install PhoneGap Desktop App 0.1.7 Beta release:

- __OS X__: Download [PhoneGap Desktop 0.1.7 for OS X](https://github.com/phonegap/phonegap-app-desktop/releases/download/0.1.7/PhoneGapDesktop.dmg)
- __Windows__: Download [PhoneGap Desktop 0.1.7 for Windows](https://github.com/phonegap/phonegap-app-desktop/releases/download/0.1.7/PhoneGapSetup.exe)

_If you have an issue with PhoneGap Desktop's auto-updater, we recommend that you manually update using the download links provided above._

## What's New ##

This release was solely focused on fixing an issue where the pairing of the PhoneGap Desktop App and PhoneGap Developer App was broken because they were both using different versions of the `connect-phonegap` module.

For those interested in the full CHANGELOG:

- [#358](https://github.com/phonegap/phonegap-app-desktop/issues/358) Download Error in iOS companion app with 0.1.6 of Desktop App
