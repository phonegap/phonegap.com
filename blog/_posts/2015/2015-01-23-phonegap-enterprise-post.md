<h1>PhoneGap Enterprise</h1>

<h3>What is it?</h3>
[PhoneGap Enterprise](http://enterprise.phonegap.com) is a new enterprise offering from [Adobe](http://adobe.com) providing the ability for both developers and marketers to easily create and manage their mobile enterprise apps. 

This new offering includes a viewer app that can be downloaded from the app stores ([iOS](https://appsto.re/us/mMWh3.i) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.adobe.pge.appviewer) currently) and allows you to view your enterprise apps built using [Adobe Experience Manager](http://docs.adobe.com/docs/en/cq/current/exploring/introduction.html) and the [Adobe Marketing Cloud ](http://www.adobe.com/solutions/digital-marketing.html) that are both under development and have been staged for publishing. The tight integration with Adobe Experience Manager also allows for all of an app's metadata to be viewed. The result is a fast and easy way for [AEM Apps](http://www.adobe.com/solutions/web-experience-management/mobile-apps-engagement.html) to be tested and used by others at any given stage of development across multiple devices. 

<h3>Benefits</h3>

1. [AEM Apps](http://www.adobe.com/solutions/web-experience-management/mobile-apps-engagement.html) - marketers can update and maintain app content using a simple drag-and-drop interface from AEM while the developers focus on building new features. They can then login using the PhoneGap Enterprise App on their mobile devices to test their updates across multiple devices during development and staging.

2. [Application Command Center](http://docs.adobe.com/docs/en/aem/6-0/develop/mobile/apps/managing-aem-mobile-apps.html) - a single interface for managing all aspects of an appâ€™s lifecycle. The Command Center enables you to keep app content fresh and relevant, while understanding how the app is performing in one intuitive view. All of your app meta data including name, description and screenshots for an app store submission are also managed from the Command Center.

3. [App Update Management](http://docs.adobe.com/docs/en/aem/6-0/develop/mobile/apps/managing-aem-mobile-apps.html#ContentSync%20Packages%20Tile) - app content can be updated instantly without requiring a trip back to the app store. Updates are managed through a straightforward workflow and tools are provided to verify content changes in development, staging, and production environments.


4. [Analytics](http://www.adobe.com/solutions/digital-analytics.html) - collect data to gather a better understanding about who's using your app and how, backed by [Adobe Analytics](http://www.adobe.com/solutions/digital-analytics.html). 

5. Support - take advantage of professional support services backed by SLA's (service-level-agreements).

6. Native App Support - embed PhoneGap into your existing native applications to leverage current investments. Check out this [reference implementation](https://github.com/Adobe-Marketing-Cloud/app-sample-android-phonegap) for more details.
