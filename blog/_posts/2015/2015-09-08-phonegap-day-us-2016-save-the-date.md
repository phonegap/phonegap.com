Save the date! **PhoneGap Day US 2016 is coming to Utah on January 29th (with workshops on January 28th)**. We'll be hosting hundreds of you at the beautiful Adobe office in Lehi, Utah. 

We're already planning brand new content all dedicated to arming you with everything you need to make great mobile apps! All you have to do is bring your app (or your idea for an app) and we'll bring the rest. 

We'll open up registration and begin announcing speakers, sponsors and sessions soon so keep your eyes on our [Twitter feed](https://twitter.com/phonegap) and [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/PhoneGap) or subscribe to PhoneGap news [here](http://phonegap.com/community/newsletter/).

*Rumor is there's some pretty great skiing in Utah at the end of January :) More info to come on that soon!*

Can't wait to see you all!
