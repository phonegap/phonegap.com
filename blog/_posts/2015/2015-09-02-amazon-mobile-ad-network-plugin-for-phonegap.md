##Introducing the Amazon Mobile Ads API Plug-in for PhoneGap##

The [Amazon Mobile Ads API Plug-in for PhoneGap](https://developer.amazon.com/public/apis/earn/mobile-ads?sc_channel=Partner&sc_brand=Mobile_Ads&sc_segment=Devs&sc_publisher=PhoneGap&sc_WW&) is now available to help you monetize your app. The Amazon Mobile Ads API is an in-app display advertising solution for monetizing mobile apps and games across many devices including phones and tablets on Android, iOS, and Fire OS. This means you can use the Amazon Mobile Ads API in your Google Play, iTunes, and Amazon App Store distributed apps. The API supports banner and interstitial ads, and serves ads to users in the US, UK, Germany, France, Spain, Italy and Japan. 

##Tips on Monetizing with Mobile Ads##

1. **Display Ads Visibly** - 320x50 banners work great on smartphones in portrait orientation. Use larger ads for tablets or apps with landscape orientation. The Amazon Mobile Ads API has an Auto Ad Size feature that automatically selects the best ad size for your app and your users' device.

2. **Work with Multiple Ad Networks and Mediate** - The best way to maximize your ad earning is to work with multiple ad networks since one ad network may not always have a suitable ad for all your users. Track the eCPM (earning per 1,000 impressions) by ad format and send ad requests to the ad network with the highest eCPM. If that ad network does not have an ad for your user, then send the ad request to other networks in order of eCPM. The Amazon Mobile Ads API can also be used with mediation services.

3. **Display Ads to Non-Paying Users** - Use analytics services to understand which users pay through in-app-purchasing and which donâ€™t. You can focus your ads to non-paying users to maximize both in-app-purchase earning and advertising earning. 

To get started, simply download and integrate the [Amazon Mobile Ads API Plug-in for PhoneGap](https://developer.amazon.com/public/apis/earn/mobile-ads/plugins?sc_channel=Partner&sc_brand=Mobile_Ads&sc_segment=Devs&sc_publisher=PhoneGap&sc_WW&) in your app built with PhoneGap.
