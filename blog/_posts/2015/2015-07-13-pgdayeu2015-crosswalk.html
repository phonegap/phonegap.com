<p>A big thanks to everyone who was able to make it to PhoneGap Day EU 2015 in Amsterdam. We'll be posting more videos from the conference so check back on our <a href="http://phonegap.com/blog/tag/phonegap-day/">blog</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/PhoneGap">Youtube channel</a>.</p>

<p>Today we're sharing a great session by our friends at <a href="https://crosswalk-project.org/">Crosswalk</a> that can help you navigate the fragmented Android market.</p>

<p>Web technologies are improving at a rapid pace. New features such as responsive design, cloud services, WebRTC, WebGL and Canvas provide developers with a great deal of potential. However, leveraging these features in a fragmented Android market is difficult, and oft-times impossible given the diversity of the various platform versions and capabilities. This session introduces the Crosswalk Project, an open-source, Chromium-based, HTML5 runtime that opens up the full set of leading-edge web innovations to Android developers and greatly reduces the fragmentation limitations. The Crosswalk Project is already available as a Cordova plugin so build and deploy steps are right at your fingertips.</p>
