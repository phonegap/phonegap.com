There's been a lot of changes to both PhoneGap and the underlining Cordova engine, so let's take a look!

## Platform Versions

- Apache Cordova Amazon-FireOS 3.6.3
- Apache Cordova Android 3.6.4
- Apache Cordova BlackBerry10 3.7.0
- Apache Cordova Browser 3.6.0

## What's New in PhoneGap

- [phonegap-cli#491](https://github.com/phonegap/phonegap-cli/issues/491) Add support for spaces in cordova binary execution path. This is more important on Windows, where it's common to use a username that includes a space.
- [phonegap-cli#155](https://github.com/phonegap/phonegap-cli/issues/155) Fix Windows output of phonegap binary name. Previously it would report `phonegap.js` instead of just `phonegap`. This was most apparent in the help dialog messages.
- [node-phonegap-build#57](https://github.com/phonegap/node-phonegap-build/issues/57) Allow a config.xml defined in the project's root directory to be uploaded to PhoneGap Build. This patches an issue overlooked in [#47](https://github.com/phonegap/node-phonegap-build/issues/47).
- [connect-phonegap#101](https://github.com/phonegap/connect-phonegap/issues/101) Fixes the create method on Windows. There was a bug where the created project included a `master/` directory instead of `www/`. This was due to how Windows copies directories with a trailing slash.
- [connect-phonegap#99](https://github.com/phonegap/connect-phonegap/issues/99) Default unregistered devices to latest Cordova version. There was a bug described in detail on issue #99, where devices auto-connecting to a restarted server would use an outdated version of Cordova.
- [connect-phonegap#103](https://github.com/phonegap/connect-phonegap/issues/103) Proxy external requests using node-http-proxy. This approach helps to preserve the original headers and rewrites the location header when provided. This helps to address issues reported in [connect-phonegap#74](https://github.com/phonegap/connect-phonegap/issues/74) and [phonegap-app-developer#175](https://github.com/phonegap/phonegap-app-developer/issues/175).
- [connect-phonegap#104](https://github.com/phonegap/connect-phonegap/issues/104) Fixed the broken host header caused by the recent proxy update in #103.

## What's New in Cordova

- You can now install a local plugin as a symbolic link instead of copying it:

        phonegap plugin add ~/path/to/phonegap-plugin-example --link
- You can now define a search path when installing local plugins:

        phonegap plugin add org.apache.cordova.geolocation --searchpath ~/path/to/search
- You can now define the search path when restoring plugins:

        phonegap restore plugins --experimental --searchpath ~/path/to/search
- [CB-8154](https://github.com/apache/cordova-lib/commit/20219874e1023688f111bf4a5c182eaa9eac752a) Improved the platform and plugin fetching logic.
- [CB-8053](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CB-8053) On Windows, a plugin can now include a project reference.
- [CB-7610](https://github.com/apache/cordova-lib/commit/c6870a1b54719662e531e5dab38beeb6213794f8) On Windows, a local plugin can now be installed from any drive letter.
- [CB-7803](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CB-7803) Enable adding any platform on any operating system. For example, add the Windows Phone platform on OS X or iOS on Windows.
