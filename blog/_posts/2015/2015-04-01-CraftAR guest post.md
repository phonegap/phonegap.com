Augmented Reality and Image Recognition tools offer a unique experience to users that can significantly impact customer engagement and make an app stand out from the others. Over the past year, we've seen a tremendous growth in interest from brands and publishers to integrate those capabilities into their apps.

Are you a mobile app developer looking for easy ways to add Augmented Reality and Image Recognition to an app? In that case, we have just the thing for you.

## Use PhoneGap for cross-platform development ##

Imagine that you only need to develop your Augmented Reality and Image Recognition native app once for **both** iOS and Android. Now you can with the [CraftAR PhoneGap Plugin](https://build.phonegap.com/plugins/1477).

This new plugin enables developers to integrate the [CraftAR Augmented Reality SDK](http://catchoom.com/product/craftar/augmented-reality-and-image-recognition-sdk/) with an app developed with the [Adobe PhoneGap](http://phonegap.com/) framework. PhoneGap is a framework that gives you the power to create cross-platform apps using web technologies like JavaScript, HTML and CSS. The CraftAR PhoneGap plugin also unlocks other HTML5 development frameworks such as [Sencha Touch](http://www.sencha.com/products/touch/).

## Customer Spotlight: Plandent ##

Plandent is one of the most important dental suppliers in Europe, with operations in 15 countries across Europe. As a high tech supplier of dental solutions, Plandent has been working with dental professionals and the world's leading dental manufacturers since 1972.

Plandent has had a long-standing focus on innovation and its Danish subsidiary collaborated with Image Recognition and Augmented Reality leader Catchoom to create an app that scans and recognizes its full range of dental products. This then allows dentists and other dental professionals to re-order supplies as and when required and all with just a few swipes.

"The development of our app and implementation of CraftAR was done by Danish development house Hesehus. They faced some technical issues with the scanning function because they developed the app with Sencha (an HTML-based development tool) as a framework." According to Peter Lippert, who led the app development project, "no prior examples were available. But, Catchoom was very helpful and did all it could in order for Hesehus to create the app we wanted."

## All the features of CraftAR ready to plug in ##

The plugin is your door to [all CraftAR tools](http://catchoom.com/product/craftar/augmented-reality-and-image-recognition/) including our award-winning [Image Recognition](http://catchoom.com/product/craftar/image-recognition/) software, and the fast and stable tracking module of the Augmented Reality SDK. Because we run our Image Recognition in the cloud, you have the advantage of scalability of very large image collections as well as [exceptional recognition performance wherever you are around the globe](http://catchoom.com/blog/image-recognition-now-faster-better-global/). Add our [user friendly web-based AR content creation tool](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V296iS4Wlew&index=1&list=PL0g-n9ycSpzTaq56xqStBBPbvC1yQJ4Uh) to the package, and you get the perfect combo for PhoneGap.
