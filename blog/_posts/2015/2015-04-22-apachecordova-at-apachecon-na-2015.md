ApacheCon NA took place last week in Austin, TX. The conference was managed by the Linux Foundation and was really well organized. It was mostly focused on infrastructure projects (Big Data, Clusters, DB & Storage, …) but Apache Cordova was still represented and had 4 dedicated talks. It was a good opportunity for Cordova committers from different companies to get together, talk about the project and share some ideas. There were people from Microsoft, Adobe, Google, Intel and Ionic. It was also a good opportunity to talk to the people behind the Apache Software foundation and discuss the pain points that Apache Cordova faces.

There was a total of 4 Cordova talks. Two of them were meant for Cordova users and the other two were more suitable for Cordova core developers.

## Apache Cordova in Action by Hazem Saleh, IBM ## 
This talk was very beginner friendly and really good for people who had never heard of Cordova before. Hazem explained what Cordova is and showed some of its capabilities. He also went over the potential issues that may arise when using the framework. He ended his presentation with a cool little javascript quiz.

## Cordova CLI vs API: Combining Cordova with Other Web Dev Tools Using Build System Workflows - Mark Koudritsky, Google ## 
This talk was for more advanced Cordova users. People who want to fine-tune their workflow. Mark presented a way of customizing the build of Cordova apps using Gulp and the Cordova API. This combination allows the easy integration of other external tools such as Sass, Less, Coffeescript, Bower, …

## Tools for Cordova Committers - Andrew Grieve, Google ##
This talks was more aimed at Cordova Core developers. Andrew presented all the useful tools for Cordova Committers. He went over CoHo, Cordova’s release management tool. He spent some time describing some of the tools that the Apache Software Foundation provides for its projects. A lot of useful information for new Cordova contributors was packed into his presentation.

## Cordova: Are Universal Apps Enough? - Eric Mittelette, Microsoft ##
Eric explained the difference between Universal apps and Cross-platform apps. He explained how Apache Cordova is able to enable both Paradigms. He demoed the Visual Studio tools for Apache Cordova which have really come a long way and should be the de-facto solution for mobile development on the Windows platform. They support all of the major platforms and offer some great features (such as debugging) that really come in handy when building cross-platform or universal mobile applications.

Overall, it was a good conference. A great opportunity to catch up with major actors in the Cordova community. If you want to learn more about Cordova or would like to talk about it, you should definitely sign up and/or submit a talk for the next ApacheCon.
