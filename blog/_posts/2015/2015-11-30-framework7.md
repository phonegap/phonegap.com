[Framework7](http://www.idangero.us/framework7) is an HTML framework for building [iOS](http://www.idangero.us/framework7/kitchen-sink-ios/) and [Android](http://www.idangero.us/framework7/kitchen-sink-material/) apps and one of [a set of open-source libraries and solutions](http://www.idangero.us/) from [iDangero.us](https://twitter.com/idangerous) authored by
[Vladimir Kharlampidi](https://twitter.com/nolimits4web).

I spent some time evaluating it recently and was pleasantly surprised to see that it now has support for [Material Design](www.idangero.us/framework7/kitchen-sink-material/ ) as well as several [new components](www.idangero.us/framework7/kitchen-sink-ios/). If you're looking for a mobile app framework to get started building beautiful hybrid apps quickly, you should make a point to check this one out. It doesn't rely on any particular framework other than it's own DOM manipulation framework ([DOM7](http://www.idangero.us/framework7/docs/dom.html#.VlTBFt-rRR0)), which is like a mobile-optimized version of jQuery. However, it can also be used with other frameworks like Angular, React etc if desired.

## Features
- [View Management](http://www.idangero.us/framework7/docs/views.html#.VlXdxt-rRR0) / [Navigation Support](http://www.idangero.us/framework7/docs/router-api.html#.VlXd5d-rRR0) - a [view](http://www.idangero.us/framework7/docs/views.html#.Vlx57d-rRR0) is a stack of [pages](http://www.idangero.us/framework7/docs/pages.html#.Vlx5zd-rRR0) with its own navigation, history and settings
- Page-level events

		myApp.onPageInit('list', function (page) {...})

- [FastClick](https://ftlabs.github.io/fastclick/) library built-in to handle click delay for touch UI's
- Easy, familiar syntax for anyone familiar with jQuery to get started quickly
- Framework agnostic - can be used with [React](https://github.com/philipshurpik/framework7-react-base), [Angular](https://github.com/valnub/Framework7-Pure-Angular-Template) and other templating engines like [Handlebars] (https://github.com/philipshurpik/Framework7-Contacts7-MVC)
- Oodles of pre-styled widgets/components. Some examples listed below but check out their kitchen sink apps for [iOS](http://www.idangero.us/framework7/kitchen-sink-ios/) and [Android](http://www.idangero.us/framework7/kitchen-sink-material/) to see them all per platform:
	- Search Bar with built-in filtering
	- Login screen

    	<div class="row">
            	<div class="col-50">50%</div>
            	<div class="col-50">50%</div>
        </div>

	- [Themes and color schemes](http://www.idangero.us/framework7/docs/color-themes.html#.VlXbF9-rRR0)

	- [Numerous options](http://www.idangero.us/framework7/docs/init-app.html#.Vi9_mhCrSu4) to handle a variety of scenarios easily (i.e: hide navbars and toolbars on scroll etc)
- Flexible Router - Load pages from templates, using Ajax, inline or dynamically via the [flexible router api](http://www.idangero.us/framework7/docs/router-api.html#.Vlx04d-rRR0)

		mainView.router.load({url: 'list.html'});

		mainView.router.load({
			template: Template7.templates.listTemplate,
			context: resp.results
		});



- Performant
	- Hardware accelerated css animations and transitions
	- [Lazy loading support](http://www.idangero.us/framework7/docs/lazy-load.html#.VlXbut-rRR0)		

    	<div data-background="path/to/image.jpg" class="lazy">

	- [Virtual list support](http://www.idangero.us/framework7/docs/virtual-list.html#.VlXc19-rRR0)

	- HTML configurable caching for faster page loading
- Bootstrap-like styles
- [Plugins API] (http://www.idangero.us/framework7/docs/plugins-api.html#.Vi-LSRCrSu4)
	- Extend the framework and share with the community. Already includes many [useful plugins listed on their site](http://www.idangero.us/framework7/plugins/#.VlUFc9-rRR0) like an welcome/tutorial screen,  indexed scroll list, 3D Panels, additional custom keyboards and more.
- Icons - includes some basic ones (menu, search), but you can use any icon font or library with it such as [Font Awesome](https://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) or [Ionicons](http://ionicons.com). Check out the starter templates on [noodl.io](https://www.noodl.io/market/category/framework7/) for more examples of using icons.
- Good docs, visual examples, starter apps and great forum support, often by the author himself.

## Built-in Helper Libraries
- [Template7](http://www.idangero.us/template7/#.Vi-JRRCrSu4) - a mobile-first lightweight template engine with [handlebars.js](http://handlebarsjs.com/) like syntax.

		<div class="list-block">
			  <ul>
				{{#each items}}
				<li class="item-content">
				  <div class="item-inner">
					<div class="item-title">{{title}}</div>
				  </div>
				</li>
				{{/each}}
			  </ul>
		</div>

- [DOM7] (http://www.idangero.us/framework7/docs/dom.html#.VlTBFt-rRR0)- jQuery-like syntax with similarly named functions optimized for mobile.

		$$('.something').on('click', function (e) {
			$$(this).addClass('hello').attr('title', 'world').insertAfter('.something-else');
		});


- [Swiper Slider](http://www.idangero.us/framework7/docs/swiper.html#.Vi-0AhCrSu4) - a customizable touch slider with support for overflow, 3D, parallax and more.

##Sample and Starter Apps
I built a sample iTunes Media Explorer app using the framework [here](https://github.com/hollyschinsky/MediaExplorerFramework7) you can reference or use as a starter app. It's a simple app utilizing the built-in DOM7 and Template7 approach.  There's also a list of [starter apps](http://www.idangero.us/framework7/apps/#.VlTGVN-rRR0) and [layouts](http://www.idangero.us/framework7/examples/#.VlTGh9-rRR0) included from their site to help get you started quickly.

- Via bower:

		$ bower install framework7

- By cloning or downloading from [the git repo](https://github.com/nolimits4web/framework7/) and using the `dist/` folder as your base starter project.
