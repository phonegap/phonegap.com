PhoneGap Day EU is just around the corner on May 18-19 in Amsterdam! We’re getting ready to host hundreds of PhoneGap users as well as 15+ speakers from around the globe ready to share how they’re innovating with PhoneGap and improving their mobile development. 

We’re excited to announce the [agenda](http://pgday.phonegap.com/eu2015/) for PhoneGap Day as well as give you a sneak peek into some of the most highly anticipated agenda items:

- **“Embedding Natively: The Hybrid Sweet Spot”** – Already have native apps as part of your mobile strategy? Learn how many developers choose to build native navigation and transitions into their apps, but use webviews for the main content, allowing them to realize a huge cost and time savings while making their app available to a wide range of users quickly.
- **"PhoneGap Year in Review"** – We packed a lot of new development into 2014 and we want to make sure you don’t miss out! Get a full rundown of the new members of the PhoneGap family and the easiest way to get started with PhoneGap, the Desktop and Developer apps, as well as get the inside scoop on what’s coming next!
- **"Snowbuddy: How we made people think it was a native app"** – Hear from the creator of [Snowbuddy](http://snowbuddyhq.com/), a killer fast ski and snowboard app that’s sure to become your best buddy on the mountain.
- **“Reframing Hybrid” with the founders and creators of [Ionic Framework](http://ionicframework.com/)** – They’ll talk about how Ionic, PhoneGap, and other hybrid technologies give app developers abilities they never had before, resulting in apps that are faster and cheaper to build, more dynamic, and more successful. Because, who doesn’t want that?
- **"Push ‘n Pull"** - Do you ever wish your users were more engaged with your app? Or that you could update its content more easily? Come learn about the new, easier to configure and use Push Plugin and how to deliver content and code updates using the all new, all different Content Sync plugin. 

Get ready to break out phones, apps, frameworks and tools. In addition to some hacking with other PhoneGap addicts, there will be talks on getting started with PhoneGap, high-speed demos and more killer presentations from PhoneGap developers. 

All that’s missing is you! So come learn about PhoneGap, the PhoneGap ecosystem and community and get your development questions answered! Spots are filling up so act fast!
