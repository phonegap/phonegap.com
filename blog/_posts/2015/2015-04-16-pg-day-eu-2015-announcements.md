We're getting ready for PhoneGap Day EU 2015 in Amsterdam next month on May 18-19 and we have some exciting announcements.

First up, we are beyond thrilled to have Ionic's creators and Drifty Co. founders, Max and Ben, join us for PhoneGap Day EU. The AngularJS based Ionic Framework has pulled ahead of the pack to make building killer fast and beautifully responsive native mobile applications easier. We're excited to have Max and Ben join us to share all the latest [Ionic goodness](http://ionicframework.com/).

You'll also hear about:

- The Android WebView
- Accessibility
- User growth for your app
- PhoneGap Enterprise
- More to be announced!

Second, we have brand new workshops this year so be sure to stay for the day after the conference to get some hands-on experience building PhoneGap apps with experts from the team:

- Beginner: This workshop will provide an introduction to PhoneGap, the philosophy behind it, and how to get started quickly using a variety of different tools available including the new PhoneGap Desktop and Developer apps.
- Advanced: Learn how to architect large, complex, and native-like PhoneGap apps using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. We will investigate mobile challenges and find solutions for them as well as learn about Single Page Architecture, HTML templates, performance techniques, frameworks and more.
- God Mode: This workshop will give an intro to PhoneGap Enterprise and AEM apps.

Lastly, we've got some awesome new swag items for all attendees. Here's a sneak peek at what we have in store:
