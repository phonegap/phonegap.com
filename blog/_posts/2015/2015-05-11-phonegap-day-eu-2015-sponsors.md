We're one week away from [PhoneGap Day EU 2015](http://pgday.phonegap.com/eu2015/) and we can't wait to join hundreds of PhoneGap users, industry experts and our sponsors: [Canonical](http://www.canonical.com/), [Crosswalk](https://crosswalk-project.org/), [Ionic](http://ionicframework.com/) and [Telerik](http://www.telerik.com/) in Amsterdam May 18-19. Here's a quick look at what each one has in store for attendees:

## Canonical ##

[Canonical](http://www.canonical.com/) are the latest sponsors to join PhoneGap Day EU 2015, providing our community with the opportunity to learn about HTML5 development on the Ubuntu operating system.   

Canonical produces Ubuntu, the leading open-source platform for cloud, personal computing and next-generation devices. Ubuntu has introduced a new mobile experience for phone users, a smarter ecosystem dynamic for developers, and unprecedented differentiation opportunities for carriers and device manufacturers.

Canonical partnered with BQ, a Spanish handset manufacturer to launch the very first Ubuntu phone - BQ Aquaris E4.5 Ubuntu Edition, which has been available to purchase from [bq.com](http://www.bq.com/gb/). Phonegap attendees will have the _exclusive_ opportunity to purchase the BQ Aquaris E4.5 Ubuntu Edition at the event in Amsterdam! BQ are selling a limited quantity of devices at the Canonical stand, be sure to get there, they’ve been selling out like hot cakes!

## Crosswalk ##

[Crosswalk](https://crosswalk-project.org/) is an open source project sponsored by Intel that enables developers to confidently deploy their web apps with code that takes advantage of the latest web innovations. Today, deploying an app with new web capabilities raises concerns around whether the web runtime on the end user device has the right JavaScript APIs available, proper support for CSS properties, correct UI rendering, etc..  Developers want to support as many versions of Android as possible, but that can be frustrating, time consuming and expensive.
 
With the Crosswalk Project, you can more easily develop around device fragmentation; provide a modern, feature rich experience on all Android 4.x devices and above; easily debug with Chrome DevTools; and improve the performance of your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Include the Crosswalk Project web runtime with your hybrid __Android__ or __Cordova / PhoneGap__ app, and users will consistently see it through a predictable, powerful WebView based on Google Chromium.

## Ionic ##

[Ionic Framework](http://ionicframework.com/) creators and Drifty Co. founders, Max Lynch and Ben Sperry, will be reframing the conversation around hybrid development and discussing ways in which hybrid development gives developers advantages over native development. They’ll talk about how Ionic, PhoneGap and other hybrid technologies give app developers abilities they never had before, resulting in apps that are faster and cheaper to build, more dynamic, and more successful.

Check out development and marketing tips from Ryan Hanna, Director of Engineering of the popular fitness app [Sworkit](http://sworkit.com/), using Ionic and PhoneGap [here](http://phonegap.com/blog/2015/03/19/sworkit-guest-post-pt1/) and [here](http://phonegap.com/blog/2015/05/06/sworkit-guest-post-pt-2/). 

## Telerik ##

Building hybrid apps is hard. In addition to actually coding an application, you also have to deal platform-specific configuration files, icons, permissions, deployment procedures, and more. That's where [Telerik](http://www.telerik.com/) comes in. With a series of tools—including cloud-based builds, dozens of high-quality (and free) Cordova plugins, and a whole lot more—Telerik provides everything you need to take the pain out of hybrid development.
