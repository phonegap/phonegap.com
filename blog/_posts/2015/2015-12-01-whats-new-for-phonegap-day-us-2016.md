We're about 2 months away from [PhoneGap Day US 2016](http://pgday.phonegap.com/) happening on Jan 28-29 in Lehi, Utah. As you may have noticed, we're shaking things up a bit. Along with a new location, we're changing a few things around to make sure this is your most successful PhoneGap Day yet. From brand new content to a bonus ski day, you don't want to miss this! Read on for the conference agenda, workshop topics and ski day details.

##Location##

We've previously held PhoneGap Day in Portland and SF, but this year we're excited to be moving PhoneGap Day US to Lehi, UT. Utah is known for an emerging tech scene and we're stoked to bring all the PhoneGap goodness to the community there.

The event itself will be held at the Adobe Lehi offices and if you haven't seen this building yet. It. Is. Amazing. The venue perfectly fit our ideas for the event and allows us to accommodate more attendees, more workshops, and more networking.

##Workshops##

It never ceases to amaze us how popular the workshops are every year. This year we wanted to make them even better so we're doing 3 tracks of workshops where you can choose your own adventure instead of being locked into one track. Instead of having to choose between beginner vs. advanced or PhoneGap Essentials vs. community sessions you'll be able to attend a choice of 3 workshops every hour (or hour and a half)
depending on your interest and skill level. The agenda isn't final yet, but here's what we have so far:

##Conference lineup##

We have a killer lineup of speakers this year! We're bringing community experts from around the globe to share their experiences with PhoneGap and their best tips and tricks to help you take your app from concept to app store. We'll have framework experts from the Ionic, Ember and React communities, app highlights from some of the most successful PhoneGap apps like [Sworkit](http://sworkit.com/) and [StoryCorps](https://storycorps.org/), PhoneGap partners like Microsoft Visual Studio, Mobify, and Crosswalk showcasing the latest tools and technology and more!

Check out the [PhoneGap Day site](http://pgday.phonegap.com/) to see the full agenda and list of speakers and sponsors.

##Ski Day##

And last, but not least, we'll be having a complimentary PhoneGap ski day for all attendees at Utah's famous [Sundance Mountain Resort](http://www.sundanceresort.com/). Great for beginners and experts, Sundance features 42 runs over 450 acres. Rather not hit the slopes? There's a winter ziptour where you'll get a breathtaking view of Utah's famous mountains, snowshoeing and some world-class dining.
