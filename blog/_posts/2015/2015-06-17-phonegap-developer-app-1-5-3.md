Yesterday we release a minor update to the PhoneGap Developer app!

## What's New

- Bumped `phonegap-plugin-contentsync@1.1.0` to prevent the caching of content on Android and iOS.
- Improved error dialog when a connection fails. We no longer suggest that you upgrade the CLI, since you may be using the Desktop app. Man, that was confusing!

## Upcoming Release

We're already gearing up for our next release! In the upcoming release you can expect to find:

- Support for the third-party [Bluetooth Low-Energy support](https://github.com/don/cordova-plugin-ble-central) plugin.
- Improved connection error diagnostics. We're still looking into why some developers are having a connection problem, so ping us if you have insight!

Cheers and thanks for using the PhoneGap Developer App!
