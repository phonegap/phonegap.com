PhoneGap Desktop App 0.1.5 Beta is now available!

## Installation ##

Download and install the PhoneGap Desktop App 0.1.5 Beta release:

- __OS X__: Download [PhoneGap Desktop 0.1.5 for OS X](https://github.com/phonegap/phonegap-app-desktop/releases/download/0.1.5/PhoneGapDesktop.dmg)
- __Windows__: Download [PhoneGap Desktop 0.1.5 for Windows](https://github.com/phonegap/phonegap-app-desktop/releases/download/0.1.5/PhoneGapSetup.exe)

_Due to an issue with PhoneGap Desktop's auto-updater, we recommend that you manually update using the download links provided above._

## What's New ##

This release focuses on adding auto-updates for OS X. After downloading and installing the release, all future releases will be auto-updated when the app is opened.

We haven't forgot about Windows users! We are currently working on completing [#291 Auto-updater for Windows users](https://github.com/phonegap/phonegap-app-desktop/issues/291).
Until complete, Windows will be notified of new updates with-in the app, but they will need to perform a manual update.

For those interested in the full CHANGELOG:

- [#232](https://github.com/phonegap/phonegap-app-desktop/issues/232) Add auto-updater support
- [#340](https://github.com/phonegap/phonegap-app-desktop/issues/340) Clean up the ISS script for compiling PhoneGapSetup.exe
