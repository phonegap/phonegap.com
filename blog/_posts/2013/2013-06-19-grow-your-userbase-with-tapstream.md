**Now Supporting PhoneGap: How to Use Tapstream to Grow Your App’s Userbase**

More and more Tapstream users continue to ask us “Do you support PhoneGap?” Well we’re excited to finally say yes we do! Our PhoneGap SDK has just been released and is ready for your PhoneGap apps. So what’s Tapstream you ask?

Simply put, Tapstream helps you with a big challenge facing every mobile app today: getting more users. By using shortlinks in your marketing campaigns Tapstream tells you not just how many clicks each one gets, but how many new users a link brings in, the cost of those users and their lifetime value. In essence, Tapstream gives you the information you need to make
datadriven app marketing decisions that can grow your userbase.

**Step 1 - Start Getting More Users**

Getting started is simple. Create Tapstream shortlinks, like http://taps.io/Hkeu, for each marketing channel or campaign you’d like to track:  
* Ads mobile ad networks or mobile web ads
* Social media updates
* Content blog posts, videos and press coverage
* Email
* Web pages, and
* Split tests for ads and landing pages.

Anywhere you can place a shortlink, Tapstream will track how many users click it, and how many go on to activate your app.

Being able to see conversion (click to activation) rates for each marketing channel you use allows you to doubledown on what’s working, and tweak your messaging to improve results.

**Is your app on more than one platform? Offer a simpler download experience**

Like most PhoneGap users, If you have more than one app you’re faced with the challenge of sending prospects to the right app store, usually via a landing page that includes all of your app store buttons. But this adds another step to the download process and [that can cost you users](http://blog.gaborcselle.com/2012/10/every-step-costs-you-20-of-users.html). Why not eliminate that extra step? A single Tapstream shortlink can identifying a user’s device type and [intelligently redirect that prospect to the correct app store](http://blog.tapstream.com/post/46945484087/tapstream-launches-smart-shortlinks-send-your-mobile).

Once you’ve begun learning which channels and messages stick with your audience, it’s time to start focusing on attracting more high value users.

**Step 2 - Discover Where Your Highest Value Users Come From, Get More**

Not all users are created equal. Some install your app and use it once and other’s use it forever but never upgrade or share it. By tracking a few inapp events that define your highest value users, Tapstream helps you learn which sources they come from.

Let’s say you have a photo sharing app. In this case you might track how many times a user posts a photo, refers a friend and makes an inapp purchase of some new filters. You give away the app for free but charge $3.00 for the bundle of filters. When you setup the in-app purchase with Tapstream, assign a value of $2.10, since Apple takes their share.

Now that you’ve setup the key events you want to measure, Tapstream will automatically track conversions and attribute them to the channel the user took to reach your app.

**Example:** Sharron activates your app, plays with it a few times, shares some photos, refers three friends, and then buys an inapp purchase bundle of photo filters. Tapstream credits all of those actions to the shortlink Sharron clicked to discover your app, including the earnings of $2.10. If you posted the shortlink on Facebook and this user behaviour seems to be normal, then you’ve found a winning channel.

*Note: Tapstream continues to track all earnings from the shortlink, so you can learn the lifetime
value of that channel.*

Start to measure a few in-app events that define your most valuable users. As a jumping-off point, [consider tracking these 9 events](http://blog.tapstream.com/post/44716411877/9-in-app-events-you-should-measure-to-boost-your-user) and ask yourself: does this action generate revenue for me? Does it help me grow my userbase?
