One of the most popular questions we get asked is “How do I find a PhoneGap Developer?”
Now we’ve got a tool to help you: Introducing the [PhoneGap Developer Directory](http://people.phonegap.com/)! We hope the Directory can be a way to connect talented PhoneGap developers with new projects and community events.

### Register

Sign up to list yourself or your company as a PhoneGap Developer. List your bio, skills, and experience using PhoneGap. Got a sweet app in the works? List it and let others see what you’re up to. Looking for work? Let everyone know by indicating you’re open to taking on new projects.

### Search

Looking for someone to hire? Search via name, location, availability, and PhoneGap contributor status. Find out what PhoneGap developers have been working on and what skills they can bring to your project.

### Contribute
Open source projects like PhoneGap/Apache Cordova would not be possible without the hard work and great contributions we receive from our community. To show our appreciation for our contributors, we’ll be placing a nice shiny star on their images to highlight their work. Interested in contributing? Check out [http://cordova.apache.org/#contribute](http://cordova.apache.org/#contribute) and sign up to the developer mailing list.

### Developer Highlights

We’ll be looking to the PhoneGap Developer Directory to profile members of the PhoneGap community. From long-time contributors to PhoneGap dev shops, we’ll highlight the amazing work these people have done with PhoneGap. Stay tuned.
