As you may know, PhoneGap supports the Windows Phone platform including the new capabilities in [Windows Phone 8](http://phonegap.com/blog/2012/12/21/apache-cordova-and-windows-phone-8)
, including IE 10. We're excited to announce a fun new challenge from our friends at [Microsoft](http://dev.windowsphone.com): The [PhoneGap Windows Phone Porting Challenge](http://www.phonegapwpchallenge.com)!

Do you have an existing PhoneGap app? Port your PhoneGap app to the Windows Phone Store. Not only will you reach a wider audience to expose your app to, but you could also win some cool prizes! 20 winners in total with 3 grand prize winners who will each receive a Windows Phone 8 and a Surface Pro, and 17 first prize winners receiving a Windows Phone 8. All winning apps will be evaluated for featured slots in the Windows Phone Store, too.

Members of a panel selected from Microsoft, PhoneGap and industry experts will choose 20 winners based on apps that are:
* Original
* Innovative
* Easy to use
* Engaging and visually appealing to the user

The challenge started May 20th and you have until June 30th to submit your apps for the Porting Challenge. Winners will be announced July 19th during [PhoneGap Day US](http://pgday.phonegap.com/us2012) in Portland, OR.  The challenge is open to developers in all countries/regions where [Windows Phone Dev Center Registration is availabe](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windowsphone/help/jj215599%28v=vs.105%29.aspx).
