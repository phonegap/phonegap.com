We’re delighted to introduce two new features for AT&T SDK for PhoneGap– [Advertising API](http://developer.att.com/developer/forward.jsp?passedItemId=13400964) and [Text to Speech transcription](http://developer.att.com/developer/forward.jsp?passedItemId=12500023#link02) (part of the Speech API update).

[Advertising](http://developer.att.com/developer/forward.jsp?passedItemId=13400964)

Create a new revenue stream through the use of customized advertising. The Advertising API allows you to incorporate a simple, easy-to-use solution that supports revenue share-based monetization of your apps through the placement of paid advertising.

[Speech – Speech to Text and Text to Speech](http://developer.att.com/developer/forward.jsp?passedItemId=12500023)

Powered by the AT&T Watson℠ speech engine, the Speech API supports speech-enabled apps that run on virtually any cellular network in the United States. There are seven speech contexts available that are built and maintained by AT&T, and we'll continue to tune them for you. Now with [Text to Speech](http://developer.att.com/developer/forward.jsp?passedItemId=12500023) functionality, you can just send us text as part of the API call, and one of our polite, well-versed characters will be happy to ‘say’ what you sent.

If you are not a current user - the AT&T SDK enables [AT&T API Platform](http://developer.att.com) services to be accessible through the PhoneGap platform to help you quickly bring PhoneGap mobile applications to market. The AT&T SDK significantly reduces the complexity of building applications that use the AT&T APIs. 

While we are working with PhoneGap to provide a separate developer tool for the AT&T HTML5 SDK, integration with Cordova web view tool and wrapping with PhoneGap allows you to integrate robust services like the AT&T Speech API into your app.

For example, using this method for the Speech API will look like this:

In addition to Advertising and Speech APIs, the SDK enables you to add the following [AT&T APIs and more](http://developer.att.com/phonegap):

[Location](http://developer.att.com/developer/forward.jsp?passedItemId=12700033)

Take your application to the next level by including your subscriber's location, with their consent. Whether your app involves mobile advertising, local search, or any of a number of other location-related activities, the Location API will make your app or service stand out over other non-connected alternatives.

[MMS](http://developer.att.com/developer/forward.jsp?passedItemId=12700039)

Multimedia Messaging Service (MMS) greatly enhances the power of your communications by moving beyond the text only capabilities of text based messaging.

[Payment](http://developer.att.com/developer/forward.jsp?passedItemId=12700035)

Monetize your apps with the Payment API. The Payment API can give your customers the convenience and security of having their in-app purchases charged directly to their AT&T bill.
