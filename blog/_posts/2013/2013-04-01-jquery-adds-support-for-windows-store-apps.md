Our friends at Microsoft had some exciting news last week\: jQuery added full support for Windows Store applications!

> The popular open source JavaScript Web framework [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) is adding full support for Windows Store applications in the [upcoming v2.0 release](http://blog.jquery.com/2013/03/01/jquery-2-0-beta-2-released/), thanks to recent contributions from [appendTo](http://appendto.com/) with technical support from Microsoft Open Technologies, Inc. (MS Open Tech). Considering the [opportunity](http://www.windowsstore.com/the-opportunity) Windows Store apps represent for developers, this is a great news for JavaScript developers who can now develop apps for Windows 8 using what they already know along with their existing JavaScript code, hopefully leading to a new wave of jQuery-based Windows Store applications.

> The Windows 8 application platform introduced support for HTML5 and JavaScript development leveraging the same standard-based HTML5 and JavaScript engines as Internet Explorer. As developers would expect, some popular open source JavaScript frameworks can already be used in the context of a Windows Store application, like [backbone.js](http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/), [Knockout.JS](http://knockoutjs.com/), [YUI](http://yuilibrary.com/). You can learn more about [how to build a Windows 8 app with YUI](http://www.yuiblog.com/blog/2013/03/12/windows-8-loves-yui/) in this YUI blog from [Jeff Burtoft](https://twitter.com/boyofgreen), HTML5 evangelist for Microsoft.

> Windows 8 provides access to all the WinRT APIs within the HTML5 development environment. Developers should be aware that there are some additional security features to consider when developing Windows 8 applications or HTML5-based cross platform applications for Windows. You can learn more about these features on MSDN.
