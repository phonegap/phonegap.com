We're excited to announce our 3rd Annual PhoneGap Day! On Friday July 19th, we're celebrating PhoneGap Day at [The LeftBank Annex](http://leftbankannex.com) in Portland, Oregon.

What's it all about? PhoneGap Day is one part conference and one part celebration where you'll meet and mingle with like-minded people interested in PhoneGap and mobile app development. You'll help us celebrate the [Apache Cordova](http://cordova.io) community's achievements and recognize their hard work on each monthly release. 

We'll have tons of speakers covering the latest on PhoneGap and PhoneGap Build, tools, apps, and more. You'll get to meet the PhoneGap team and connect with other PhoneGap developers from Google, Mozilla, Microsoft, and more.

And of course, what's a PhoneGap event without some beer? We'll be serving a catered breakfast, lunch and snacks with plenty of beer to go around. We've got a few tricks up our sleeve to make this event really special, including some limited edition PhoneGap swag that's being created especially for this event.
