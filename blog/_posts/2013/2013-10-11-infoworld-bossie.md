Each year, [InfoWorld's Bossies](http://www.infoworld.com/infoworld-bossie-awards-755) (Best of Open Source Software awards) recognize the best open source software for business. This year's edition of awards rounds up more than 120 top projects in seven categories. PhoneGap was one of the top picks in the Open Source Application Development Tool category.

Steven Nu√±ez from InfoWorld specifically highlights our latest release as a strength: "*Version 3, released in July of this year, is a major upgrade, streamlining the architecture around the idea of individual plug-ins that can be used across most mobile operating systems*".
