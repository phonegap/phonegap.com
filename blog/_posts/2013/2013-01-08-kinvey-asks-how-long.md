Developers who are wondering how long it will take them to build v1 of a native iOS or Android app might just have an answer -- about 18 weeks -- thanks to our partner [Kinvey](http://kinvey.com). Based on a survey of 100 mobile developers, this [infographic](http://www.kinvey.com/blog/2086/how-long-does-it-take-to-build-a-mobile-app) depicts how much time developers will spend on each component of their native apps front- and backend.
