[Adobe TechLive](http://techlive.adobe.com) is a new Adobe offering that delivers live interactive technical events. All events take place in Adobe Connect sessions so you can engage and get your questions answered from a variety of people: Adobe Developer Evangelists, Product Managers, and more. This is awesome for those who can't attend a meetup or live too far away!

In February, Adobe TechLive has a calendar full of PhoneGap related content that you might be interested in:
