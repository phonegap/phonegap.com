We have just released PhoneGap 2.9.0! Thanks to everyone who worked so hard to get this release out. As always, you can download PhoneGap by clicking the download button above. We also recommend checking out [Michael Brooks'](https://twitter.com/mwbrooks) post on our new [PhoneGap CLI](http://log.michaelbrooks.ca/post/phonegap-cli-preview). This will be the preferred way to develop PhoneGap apps post 3.0.

With 3.0 looming, this will be the last 2.x release. Read more from [Brian LeRoux](https://twitter.com/brianleroux) about [What to expect in PhoneGap 3.0](http://phonegap.com/blog/2013/06/20/coming-soon-phonegap30/). We'll be unveiling 3.0 at [PhoneGap Day US](http://pgday.phonegap.com/us2013/) in Portland, OR on July 19. Join us at PhoneGap Day to hear the news firsthand!

You can view the 2.9.0 commits in the changelog on [GitHub](https://github.com/phonegap/phonegap/blob/2.9.0/changelog).
