We have just released the first release candidate for PhoneGap 2.9.0! Thanks to everyone who worked so hard to get this release out. You can download PhoneGap 2.9.0rc1 on our [Github](https://github.com/phonegap/phonegap/archive/2.9.0rc1.zip).

This quick turnaround from 2.8.1 will allow us to spend more time focusing on PhoneGap 3.0. Read more from [Brian LeRoux](https://twitter.com/brianleroux) about [What to expect in PhoneGap 3.0](http://phonegap.com/blog/2013/06/20/coming-soon-phonegap30/). We'll be unveiling 3.0 at [PhoneGap Day US](http://pgday.phonegap.com/us2013/) in Portland, OR on July 19. Join us at PhoneGap Day to hear the news firsthand!

You can view the 2.9.0rc1 commits in the changelog on [GitHub](https://github.com/phonegap/phonegap/blob/2.9.0rc1/changelog).
