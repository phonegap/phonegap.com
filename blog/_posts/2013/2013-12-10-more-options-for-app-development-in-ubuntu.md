Great news everyone! Our friends at [Canonical](http://www.canonical.com/) has shared this:

>Canonical opens the doors to over 400,000 web developers with the announcement that the upcoming release of Cordova 3.3 will support Ubuntu. This makes it really easy for developers to bring their existing Cordova mobile apps to Ubuntu on smartphones.

>PhoneGap is a mobile application development framework, based on the open source [Apache Cordova](http://cordova.io) project. It allows you to write an app once with HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and then deploy it to a wide range of mobile devices without losing the features of a native app.  Cordova supports a variety of mobile platforms like Android and iOS, and now also Ubuntu.

>We’ve developed many paths for application development in the design of Ubuntu for phones.  The platform already supports HTML5 as well as QML as a native toolkit.  With Cordova in their toolset, developers will have another easy path to bring new application creations for Ubuntu.

>Ubuntu is easy to build on.  We’ve always sought to use the best open source tools like Cordova and Qt.  With freely available tools like Cordova, we’re committed to make it as easy as possible available for app developers to target Ubuntu.

We're excited Canonical chose to make Cordova a first on their mobile platform. The ability to target multiple platforms is one of Cordova/PhoneGap's strengths and we look forward to seeing what developers create.
