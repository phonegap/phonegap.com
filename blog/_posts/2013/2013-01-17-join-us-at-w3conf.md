The PhoneGap team is part of an awesome group within Adobe that's committed to making web standards as accessible as possible to web developers. One of our goals is to base the PhoneGap API on web standards, and in turn see some of these standards be implemented in today’s modern browsers.

As part of our commitment, we’re proud to sponsor the [W3Conf](http://www.w3.org/conf/) on Feb 21-22 in San Francisco, CA. W3Conf is the W3C's annual conference for web professionals. If you’re a web developer or designer, this is a great way to get the latest news on HTML5, CSS, and the open web platform.

We’re excited to see this great line-up of speakers:

- Eric Meyer – creator of CSS Reset, &amp; author of CSS: The definitive guide – with his talk The Era of Intentional Layout.
- Lea Verou – creator of Dabblet, Prefixfree – with her talk on More CSS Secrets: Another 10 things you may not know about CSS.
- Ariya Hridayat – creator of PhantomJS, Esprima – with his talk on Fluid User Interface with Hardware Acceleration.
- Nicolas Gallagher – creator of normalize.css, maintainer of HTML5 Boilerplate – with his talk on Questioning Best Practices.
