Great news! Two reports were recently published by Gartner that demonstrate what we've long been working toward -- Adobe, with PhoneGap in particular, is a leader in the mobile app development space.

The first Gartner report, “Magic Quadrant for Mobile Application Development Platforms”, is an assessment of the major vendors that enable enterprise IT developers to create mobile apps.

This year’s Gartner research placed Adobe in the Leader Quadrant for Mobile App Development Platforms, along with five other vendors (22 vendors were evaluated). In the report, Gartner notes, "Adobe PhoneGap, plus its open-source counterpart Apache Cordova, has wide industry support and utilization, available in offerings from SAP, Oracle, IBM, salesforce.com and Google." In the report, PhoneGap is highlighted as a Strength for its “simple concept which is compatible with a wide range of cross-platform Web technologies, including HTML5, CSS, JavaScript libraries and frameworksfrom other vendors.” Thanks to PhoneGap's flexibility, the community benefits from a plugin architecture that addresses app developer's needs.

The second Gartner report, "Critical Capabilities for Mobile Application Development Platforms", evaluates 11 vendors and how they stack up in delivering on 15 critical capabilities for mobile app development. For Adobe, the report’s primary focus was on PhoneGap. Cutting to the chase: Adobe scored highly overall and achieved a score of 'Excellent' for Product Viability.
