With the release of the BlackBerry 10 platform, the [Apache Cordova](http://cordova.io)/PhoneGap team have decided to focus efforts on creating the best possible framework for mobile apps on BlackBerry devices. To further this goal, support will be deprecated for the venerable BlackBerry Java platform with the release of Cordova 3.0 in July 2013.

Cordova is undergoing a major architectural transformation as we near 3.0. This transformation will bring a uniform interface for creating and managing Cordova Applications, and a universal plugin-based architecture. We will be focussing our efforts on BlackBerry 10 and PlayBook support.

Rest assured, this will in no way prevent you from building apps for BlackBerry 7 and below using Cordova 2.9.
