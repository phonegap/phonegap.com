We have just released PhoneGap 2.3.0! Thanks to everyone who worked so hard to get this release out! 
 
In this release we are excited to announce full support for [Windows Phone 8](http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us). Thanks to Microsoft for their major contributions to [Apache Cordova](http://cordova.apache.org/). You can view more details about PhoneGap and Windows Phone 8 in [Jesse MacFadyen’s](http://twitter.com/purplecabbage) [blog post](http://phonegap.com/blog/2012/12/21/apache-cordova-and-windows-phone-8/).

This release includes the first cut of the long awaited InAppBrowser API (formerly called ChildBrowser). You can read more about InAppBrowser in [Shazron Abdullah's](http://twitter.com/shazron) [blog post](http://shazronatadobe.wordpress.com/2012/11/21/inappbrowser-based-on-childbrowser-in-cordova-2-3-0/). We have done extensive testing on this feature, but as always, report any bugs to our [issue tracker](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CB). 

This release also includes various bug fixes. For a more in-depth look on the changes, check out Shaz’s blog about [What’s New in Cordova iOS 2.3.0](http://shazronatadobe.wordpress.com/2012/12/10/whats-new-in-cordova-ios-2-3-0/) and [Simon MacDonald's](http://twitter.com/macdonst) blog about [What's New in PhoneGap Android 2.3.0](http://simonmacdonald.blogspot.com/2012/12/whats-new-in-phonegap-android-230.html).
