We have just released the [first release candidate (RC) for PhoneGap 2.5.0](https://github.com/phonegap/phonegap/archive/2.5.0rc1.zip) and plan on releasing the official release in the coming days.

If you find any bugs with this version, help out our community and project by reporting them on our <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CB">issue tracker</a>. Rest assured, we only tag a release candidate if we are happy with where the code is.
