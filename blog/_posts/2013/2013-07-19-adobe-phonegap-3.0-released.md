Today we’re celebrating the launch of PhoneGap 3.0 at PhoneGap Day in Portland, OR!  We couldn’t have done it without the entire PhoneGap/Apache Cordova community working together to hit this major milestone. Thank you for all for your hard work!

Here’s our official announcement:

**Adobe PhoneGap 3.0 Released at 3rd Annual PhoneGap Day**<br/>
_Popular open source mobile development framework gets upgrades including new plugin architecture, improved tools, new platforms, and new APIs._ 

Adobe® PhoneGap(tm), the popular open source mobile app development framework,  released PhoneGap 3.0 today at the 3rd annual PhoneGap Day in Portland, Oregon.
PhoneGap allows developers to build cross-platform mobile applications using HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript. With PhoneGap, you can re-use your existing web developer skills and use the PhoneGap API to gain access to native features that aren’t accessible in mobile browsers.

We’re excited to announce the following major new features in PhoneGap 3.0:

- New plugin architecture - Our plugin architecture keeps your app small and fast. You only include the APIs you need and plugins can be automatically installed and removed.
- Better tools - We’ve made it easier to quickly shift between native platforms without learning new vocabularies by aligning the native platform CLI tooling. Don't have a native platform SDK installed? No problem! Our tools now integrate with PhoneGap/Build.
- New platforms - Earlier this year we welcomed support for iOS6 (with work on iOS7 happening now!), Windows Phone 8, and BlackBerry 10. Firefox OS and Ubuntu are coming soon.
- New APIs - Welcome to two new APIs – InAppBrowser (formerly known as the ChildBrowser plugin) and Globalization API.

With the PhoneGap CLI, users will be able to directly install PhoneGap from the Node Package Manager (NPM). You no longer need to download a ZIP file every time PhoneGap has a new release. This is all part of our effort to improve user workflow and make the process lightning fast.

> “PhoneGap 3 makes building for all the major mobile platforms a consistently smooth experience with the new CLI tools. I’m particularly excited to see what the community does with the new plugin infrastructure in the coming year. We’re committed to working with plugin developers to make sure the entire community ecosystem works well on the PhoneGap 3 bits.“ - Brian LeRoux

> “PhoneGap 3 represents a significant step forward in authoring mobile apps using HTML, CSS, JavaScript. We couldn’t have done it without the support of all the committers at Apache Cordova and our partners at Intel, Google, Microsoft, Blackberry, IBM, and Mozilla.” - Andre Charland
