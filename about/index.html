  <p>Building applications for each device–iPhone, Android, Windows Mobile and more–requires different frameworks and languages. PhoneGap solves this by using standards-based web technologies to bridge web applications and mobile devices. Since PhoneGap apps are standards compliant, they’re future-proofed to work with browsers as they evolve. Read an in-depth post <a href="/2012/05/02/phonegap-explained-visually/">explaining PhoneGap visually</a>.</p>
  <p>PhoneGap has been downloaded over 1 million times and is being used by over 400,000 developers. Thousands of apps built using PhoneGap are available in mobile app stores and directories. Check out some of them <a href="/apps">here</a>.</p>
  <p>The PhoneGap code was contributed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under the name <a href="http://cordova.io">Apache Cordova</a> and graduated to top-level project status in October 2012. Through the ASF, future PhoneGap development will ensure open stewardship of the project. It will always remain free and open source under the Apache License, Version 2.0.</p>
